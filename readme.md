You keep forgetting this everytime - 

* Run "jekyll server --drafts --watch".
* To fix hebrew encoding you are currently using gedit, everything else fails
* Stop trying to config vim and atom, you tried it already, it's a waste of time
* You just waited another 15 minutes on vim, right? dumbass..
